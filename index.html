                      Sea levels are rising for various reasons related to global warming. The glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland,
                      known as ice caps or ice sheets, play a major role in changes in sea level. Is it possible to predict future
                      changes in these ice caps, and particularly the calving of icebergs into the ocean?

                    The contribution of ice caps to sea level rise is essentially a combination of three phenomena: snowfalls and
                    melting of ice on the surface, due to climate change and variations in glacier altitude; thinning of floating ice
                    shelves, which are melting from below because the ocean is warming up; and the discharge of ice into the sea when
                    ice flowing towards the sea breaks off, calving icebergs.

                    The physical processes in an ice cap, both inside and on the surface, are being studied by glaciologists, in
                    collaboration with climatologists, oceanologists, mathematicians and computer scientists. A numerical model based
                    on mathematical equations can be used to simulate the ice cap dynamics, particularly the calving of icebergs.
                    Algorithms solve the equations and are used in the computer codes.

                            Ice is a fluid that flows under the influence of gravity. It flows much more slowly than liquid water because it
                            has different characteristics. In particular, ice is a plastic fluid, i.e. it changes shape when it flows. The
                            physical and mechanical properties of ice change with pressure and temperature. Pressure increases with depth
                            because of the weight of the ice, and temperature, which is very low on the surface, also increases with depth.
                            Consequently, the velocity of the glacier varies in intensity and direction inside the ice cap.

                          <p>
                            When the ice is cold, at the base it sticks to the bedrock and the friction forces reduce its velocity. The
                            temperature at the base, as inside the glacier, increases with the geothermal flux, which is the heat given off by
                            the earth’s crust. When the ice is at its melting point (0°C), a film of meltwater enables it to slide and
                            increases its velocity.

                            In Antarctica and Greenland, the areas where sliding is greatest are on the coast, in valleys resembling canyons
                            or fjords. These rivers of ice, known as outlet glaciers, can have spectacular velocities, above 10 km per year.

                            On the surface, ice is added to the existing glacier by precipitations and by the refreezing of water: this is
                            accumulation. However, ice also disappears because it melts or because of the wind: this is ablation. The weather
                            conditions and temperature at the surface of the ice cap have an effect on the amount of precipitation as well as
                            on melting and wind transportation, and therefore on accumulation and ablation and consequently on the glacier’s
                            altitude. When the surface temperature increases because of global warming, the ice melts and the altitude
                            decreases through ablation. But the temperature increases when the altitude decreases, so the glacier continues to
                            melt and thin. This phenomenon can therefore escalate and the ice cap can quickly disappear.

                            This instability of small ice caps is an example of feedback loop, where a cause produces an effect, which in turn
                            has a reinforcing impact on that cause.

                            Fast outlet glaciers lose large amounts of ice in the form of icebergs and thus contribute to sea level rise.
                            Floating ice shelves are an extension of ice caps over the ocean. When seawater temperature rises, they melt from
                            the base, raising the sea level. This sea level rise in turn affects the velocity of the glacier: feedback can be
                            observed between the different physical processes. The sea level rise changes the grounding line, which is the line
                            where the ice cap starts to float. This modifies the geometry of the ice shelf, and consequently the flow of ice.

                        The ice flows because it is a fluid. The model expresses two fundamental laws of physics as equations. On the
                        one hand, the ice is an incompressible fluid, so when a cube of ice changes shape, its volume and mass remain the
                        same: this is the law of conservation of mass. On the other hand, the ice is at equilibrium, so the sum of the
                        forces acting on a cube of ice is zero: this is the law of conservation of momentum, or Newton’s second law, when
                        acceleration is zero.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The forces acting on a cube of ice are due to gravity, pressure and viscosity. To compute the force due to
                        viscosity, a relationship must be defined between the velocity of the fluid and the mechanical stresses due to the
                        plasticity of the fluid. Glaciologists use Glen’s law, which brings temperature into the equation and models the
                        characteristics of the ice crystals.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        An equation is also needed to define the temperature inside the ice: this is the law of conservation of energy,
                        which accounts for geothermal flux and surface temperature. In practice, the temperature is often computed
                        separately with a simplified model. Thus a set of equations is obtained in which the unknowns are the velocity of
                        the fluid (intensity and direction) and the pressure, throughout the volume of the glacier. This system of
                        equations is known as the Stokes Equations. They are a simplified version of the notorious Navier-Stokes Equations,
                        for which a 1 million dollar prize has been offered to anyone who can solve them. The Stokes Equations describe the
                        relationships between the variations in velocity and pressure in each direction: they are partial differential
                        equations.

                        The friction and sliding conditions are complex and are often modelled using a law of friction (another partial
                        differential equation) which involves a friction coefficient specific to the glacier being studied. This
                        coefficient varies in space and is very difficult to measure.

                        In addition, the altitude of the bedrock can vary. The bedrock slowly sinks under the weight of the ice and slowly
                        rises again when the ice melts. There is feedback between the surface mass balance, the glacier flow, and the
                        altitude of the bedrock. This rebound, known as isostasy, happens after around 10,000 years and can therefore be
                        ignored when changes in the ice sheet over a century are being studied.

                        The surface altitude can increase through accumulation or decrease through ablation. It can also vary because of
                        the glacier’s movement. The equation expressing the change over time in the surface altitude is the surface mass
                        balance. Accumulation and ablation are computed using a climate model, while the change due to movement is
                        calculated with the glacier’s surface velocity.

                        The grounding line is the place where the ice cap starts to float on the ocean. The floating ice shelf is also
                        subject to the buoyancy force exerted by the water. There is an equation expressing the balance of forces for the
                        boundary between the ice cap and the ocean, accounting for the difference in density between ice and water.

                    To predict the ice sheet behaviour, it is necessary to compute the surface altitude at regular intervals, e.g.
                    every year. To do this, it is necessary to update the Surface Mass Balance (SMB), which depends on velocity and
                    weather conditions. It is also necessary to adjust the glacier’s velocity, which depends on the altitude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the surface altitude for year 0 is known from measurements, the velocity for year 0 can be computed using the
                    Stokes Equations. The Surface Mass Balance can then be computed for year 0 and the surface altitude for year 1 is
                    worked out from this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The velocity for year 1 can then be computed, followed by the Surface Mass Balance, and then the surface altitude
                    for year 2, etc.

                        The first step is to go from unknowns that are everywhere defined to unknowns defined by a finite number of values.
                        This step is known as spatial discretisation. The surface of the glacier is cut up into small triangles, and the
                        thickness of the glacier into slices, which results in the division of the glacier’s volume into prisms (kinds of
                        ice cubes), creating what is known as a mesh.
