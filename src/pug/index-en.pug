  p.
    Sea levels are rising for various reasons related to global warming. The glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland,
    known as ice caps or ice sheets, play a major role in changes in sea level. Is it possible to predict future
    changes in these ice caps, and particularly the calving of icebergs into the ocean?

block s2-title
  | Contribution to sea level rise

block s2-text
  p.
    The contribution of ice caps to sea level rise is essentially a combination of three phenomena: snowfalls and
    melting of ice on the surface, due to climate change and variations in glacier altitude; thinning of floating ice
    shelves, which are melting from below because the ocean is warming up; and the discharge of ice into the sea when
    ice flowing towards the sea breaks off, calving icebergs.

    The physical processes in an ice cap, both inside and on the surface, are being studied by glaciologists, in
    collaboration with climatologists, oceanologists, mathematicians and computer scientists. A numerical model based
    on mathematical equations can be used to simulate the ice cap dynamics, particularly the calving of icebergs.
    Algorithms solve the equations and are used in the computer codes.

    Ice is a fluid that flows under the influence of gravity. It flows much more slowly than liquid water because it
    has different characteristics. In particular, ice is a plastic fluid, i.e. it changes shape when it flows. The
    physical and mechanical properties of ice change with pressure and temperature. Pressure increases with depth
    because of the weight of the ice, and temperature, which is very low on the surface, also increases with depth.
    Consequently, the velocity of the glacier varies in intensity and direction inside the ice cap.

block s4-switch-text-2
  h2 At the base
  p.
    When the ice is cold, at the base it sticks to the bedrock and the friction forces reduce its velocity. The
    temperature at the base, as inside the glacier, increases with the geothermal flux, which is the heat given off by
    the earth’s crust. When the ice is at its melting point (0°C), a film of meltwater enables it to slide and
    increases its velocity.
  p.
    In Antarctica and Greenland, the areas where sliding is greatest are on the coast, in valleys resembling canyons
    or fjords. These rivers of ice, known as outlet glaciers, can have spectacular velocities, above 10 km per year.

block s4-switch-text-3
  h2 On the surface
  p.
    On the surface, ice is added to the existing glacier by precipitations and by the refreezing of water: this is
    accumulation. However, ice also disappears because it melts or because of the wind: this is ablation. The weather
    conditions and temperature at the surface of the ice cap have an effect on the amount of precipitation as well as
    on melting and wind transportation, and therefore on accumulation and ablation and consequently on the glacier’s
    altitude. When the surface temperature increases because of global warming, the ice melts and the altitude
    decreases through ablation. But the temperature increases when the altitude decreases, so the glacier continues to
    melt and thin. This phenomenon can therefore escalate and the ice cap can quickly disappear.
  p.
    This instability of small ice caps is an example of feedback loop, where a cause produces an effect, which in turn
    has a reinforcing impact on that cause.

block s4-switch-text-4
  h2 At sea level
  p.
    Fast outlet glaciers lose large amounts of ice in the form of icebergs and thus contribute to sea level rise.
    Floating ice shelves are an extension of ice caps over the ocean. When seawater temperature rises, they melt from
    the base, raising the sea level. This sea level rise in turn affects the velocity of the glacier: feedback can be
    observed between the different physical processes. The sea level rise changes the grounding line, which is the line
    where the ice cap starts to float. This modifies the geometry of the ice shelf, and consequently the flow of ice.

  p.
    The ice flows because it is a fluid. The model expresses two fundamental laws of physics as equations. On the
    one hand, the ice is an incompressible fluid, so when a cube of ice changes shape, its volume and mass remain the
    same: this is the law of conservation of mass. On the other hand, the ice is at equilibrium, so the sum of the
    forces acting on a cube of ice is zero: this is the law of conservation of momentum, or Newton’s second law, when
    acceleration is zero.
  p.
    The forces acting on a cube of ice are due to gravity, pressure and viscosity. To compute the force due to
    viscosity, a relationship must be defined between the velocity of the fluid and the mechanical stresses due to the
    plasticity of the fluid. Glaciologists use Glen’s law, which brings temperature into the equation and models the
    characteristics of the ice crystals.
  p.
    An equation is also needed to define the temperature inside the ice: this is the law of conservation of energy,
    which accounts for geothermal flux and surface temperature. In practice, the temperature is often computed
    separately with a simplified model. Thus a set of equations is obtained in which the unknowns are the velocity of
    the fluid (intensity and direction) and the pressure, throughout the volume of the glacier. This system of
    equations is known as the Stokes Equations. They are a simplified version of the notorious Navier-Stokes Equations,
    for which a 1 million dollar prize has been offered to anyone who can solve them. The Stokes Equations describe the
    relationships between the variations in velocity and pressure in each direction: they are partial differential
    equations.

block s5-switch-text-2
  h2 At the base
  p.
    The friction and sliding conditions are complex and are often modelled using a law of friction (another partial
    differential equation) which involves a friction coefficient specific to the glacier being studied. This
    coefficient varies in space and is very difficult to measure.
  p.
    In addition, the altitude of the bedrock can vary. The bedrock slowly sinks under the weight of the ice and slowly
    rises again when the ice melts. There is feedback between the surface mass balance, the glacier flow, and the
    altitude of the bedrock. This rebound, known as isostasy, happens after around 10,000 years and can therefore be
    ignored when changes in the ice sheet over a century are being studied.

block s5-switch-text-3
  h2 On the surface
  p.
    The surface altitude can increase through accumulation or decrease through ablation. It can also vary because of
    the glacier’s movement. The equation expressing the change over time in the surface altitude is the surface mass
    balance. Accumulation and ablation are computed using a climate model, while the change due to movement is
    calculated with the glacier’s surface velocity.
  p.
    The surface mass balance is also a partial differential equation, with not only spatial variations in the altitude
    but also variations over time.

block s5-switch-text-4
  h2 At sea level
  p.
    The grounding line is the place where the ice cap starts to float on the ocean. The floating ice shelf is also
    subject to the buoyancy force exerted by the water. There is an equation expressing the balance of forces for the
    boundary between the ice cap and the ocean, accounting for the difference in density between ice and water.
  p.
    There is also an equation for the ice cap’s other boundaries, to complete the system.

block s6-text
  p.
    To predict the ice sheet behaviour, it is necessary to compute the surface altitude at regular intervals, e.g.
    every year. To do this, it is necessary to update the Surface Mass Balance (SMB), which depends on velocity and
    weather conditions. It is also necessary to adjust the glacier’s velocity, which depends on the altitude.
  p.
    Since the surface altitude for year 0 is known from measurements, the velocity for year 0 can be computed using the
    Stokes Equations. The Surface Mass Balance can then be computed for year 0 and the surface altitude for year 1 is
    worked out from this.
  p.
    The velocity for year 1 can then be computed, followed by the Surface Mass Balance, and then the surface altitude
    for year 2, etc.

    If the surface altitude for year n is known, it is possible to compute the velocity for year n by solving the
    Stokes partial differential equations.
  p.
    The first step is to go from unknowns that are everywhere defined to unknowns defined by a finite number of values.
    This step is known as spatial discretisation. The surface of the glacier is cut up into small triangles, and the
    thickness of the glacier into slices, which results in the division of the glacier’s volume into prisms (kinds of
    ice cubes), creating what is known as a mesh.

    The Stokes equations are then converted to a system of complicated algebraic equations (without any derivatives),
    with as many equations as unknowns. It is not possible to solve exactly such a system; therefore the solution is
    approximated in a sequence of steps. The iterative algorithm is stopped when a quantity related to the error is
    small enough.

    A computer code can simulate changes to the ice shelf by applying the weather conditions at the surface, supplied
    for example by the IPCC’s climate models. These weather data depend on the socioeconomic scenario chosen.

  p.
    To compute the velocity and altitude with a good level of accuracy, a high resolution mesh is required, especially
    in areas of high velocity. But the number of equations increases as the mesh resolution increases and the
    computation time increases with the number of equations. As with most numerical simulations, a tradeoff has to be
    found between the accuracy of the result and the computation time.
